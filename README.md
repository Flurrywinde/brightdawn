# Bright Dawn Projects and Discussions
I'm thinking why not try the github platform for Brightdawn's project management?
## Projects
Add a project as a [new issue](https://github.com/Flurrywinde/brightdawn/issues/). After this, it can be assigned to people, milestones created, etc.
## Discussions
Maybe we can also discuss things here too? [The Brightdawn Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/1057449448659238952/) seems to be getting a little cluttered, so maybe github's [issues](https://github.com/Flurrywinde/brightdawn/issues/) might work well for these too.
